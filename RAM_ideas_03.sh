### Phase 1: Secure Bootstrapping
**Goal:** Start from a minimal, trusted environment to avoid interference.
1. Boot into a Live OS (e.g., Tails, SystemRescue) from a read-only USB/CD.
2. Mount a RAM disk for all operations:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=2G tmpfs /mnt/secure_workspace
   cd /mnt/secure_workspace
   ```

### Phase 2: Download ISO Securely
**Goal:** Fetch the ISO without leaving traces or exposing to tampering.
1. Download ISO and verify integrity (checksum + GPG signature):
   ```bash
   curl -sSLo os.iso "https://trusted-mirror/your-os.iso" \
     && curl -sSL "https://trusted-mirror/os.iso.sha256" -o os.iso.sha256 \
     && curl -sSL "https://trusted-mirror/os.iso.sig" -o os.iso.sig
   ```
2. Verify checksum and signature:
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c os.iso.sha256 \
     && gpg --verify os.iso.sig os.iso
   ```

### Phase 3: Prepare USB Stick In-Memory
**Goal:** Partition and write the ISO to the USB stick without disk writes.
1. Identify the USB device:
   ```bash
   lsblk  # Confirm /dev/sdX is the target USB
   ```
2. Partition the USB in-memory (EFI + OS partitions):
   ```bash
   sudo parted /dev/sdX --script mklabel gpt \
     mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 512MiB \
     mkpart OS ext4 512MiB 100% \
     set 1 esp on
   ```
3. Write ISO to the OS partition:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=os.iso of=/dev/sdX2 bs=4M status=progress
   ```

### Phase 4: Install rEFInd Directly from RAM
**Goal:** Fetch and execute rEFInd installation without disk writes.
1. Download rEFInd script and verify its hash:
   ```bash
   refind_script=$(curl -sSL "https://trusted-source.com/refind-install.sh") \
     && echo "$refind_script" | sha256sum --check <(curl -sSL "https://trusted-source.com/refind-install.sh.sha256")
   ```
2. Install rEFInd to the EFI partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/efi \
     && sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/efi \
     && echo "$refind_script" | sudo bash -s -- --yes --root /mnt/efi
   ```

### Phase 5: Harden the USB Stick
**Goal:** Ensure partitions are immutable and tamper-proof.
1. Set immutable flags on critical files:
   ```bash
   sudo chattr +i /mnt/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf \
     && sudo chattr +i /mnt/efi/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi
   ```
2. Enable Secure Boot (optional): Sign rEFInd with your own keys:
   ```bash
   sudo sbsign --key /path/to/db.key --cert /path/to/db.crt --output /mnt/efi/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi /mnt/efi/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi
   ```

### Phase 6: Verify USB Integrity
**Goal:** Confirm no tampering occurred during setup.
1. Check hashes post-creation:
   ```bash
   sha256sum /mnt/efi/EFI/refind/refind_x64.efi
   ```
2. Scan for hidden partitions:
   ```bash
   fdisk -l /dev/sdX | grep -i "hidden"
   ```

### Phase 7: Cleanup and Burn Bridges
**Goal:** Leave no traces in RAM or compromised mounts.
1. Wipe the secure workspace:
   ```bash
   umount /mnt/secure_tmp
   rm -rf /mnt/secure_tmp
   ```
2. Kill suspicious processes before rebooting:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E 'kworker/[emailÂ protected]|systemd-udevd' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```

### Final Advice
1. Rebuild your SystemRescue USB from a trusted source.
2. Use Tails OS for high-risk operations.
3. Disconnect from the network after downloading tools/ISO.

This workflow ensures a secure and tamper-resistant process while leveraging memory-only operations.
